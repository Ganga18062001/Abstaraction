//Relation between interface and class
1) 1 class extends 1 class
2) 1 class implements multiple interfaces
3) 1 interface extends multiple interface

4) 1 abstract class implement multiple interface does not need to implement method
5) but 1 class implement multiple interface it must be implement method


**********Initerface***********
//100 abstraction achieve in interface because only allowed abstract method
// by default method is abstract
//only allowed abstarct method
//by default all variable are "public static final"
//does not allow any access modifier in interface to method but in java 17 private is allowed

**********abstraction***********************
//in abstract there are both abstract and non abstract method is allowed that why it
not achive 100 abstraction

//in abstraction we can use all modifier to the method and variable


********diiffrence bitween abstarction and interface********

//in abstaction we can use constructor but in interface it can  not allow costructor
